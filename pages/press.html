                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>Student Showcase

                    Congratulations to Ethan Salvadalena who will be the Director of Public Relations for the Interfraternity Council. Ethan and nine others have specific jobs that oversee all 26 fraternities on Greek row. He will oversee running the IFC Instagram page. The focus of running this account is designing graphics, working with other councils on collaborative posts, putting together a posting schedule, and doing advertising for formal recruitment.
                    
                    We are proud to say Ethan is the first DTC major to be accepted into this position. He is excited to use all of what he has learned in his DTC classes for this role. He plans to set a new standard for this job and show the great work that DTC students are capable of!
